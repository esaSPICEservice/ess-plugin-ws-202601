# ESS-PLUGIN: JUICE observations synergies workshop (2026-01)

⚠️ ***Due to the recent ESA security incident, this instruction manual has been created to reflect the temporary workarounds for the workshop.***


## 🛠️ Configuring the plugin (only first time)

* Getting the JUICE SPICE Kernels
* Setting up the SKD
* Getting Cosmographia
* Getting the Cosmographia plugin
* Setting up the Cosmographia plugin


### 1. Getting the JUICE SPICE Kernels

⚠️ Temporary workaround⚠️

The latest version of the SKD's operational sub-set -including only the latest kernels listed on the metakernel- can be obtained via:

[Direct Download](https://spiftp.esac.esa.int/data/SPICE/JUICE/misc/skd/JUICE.zip) (Zip file with the latest version of the JUICE SKD in Git)
Browse the kernels individually

```
https://spiftp.esac.esa.int/data/SPICE/JUICE/misc/skd/JUICE.zip
```

### 2. Setting up the SKD

* Unzip the JUICE SKD zip file on your filesystem.

⚠️ ***SPICE toolkit has limitations on path lengths. Try to to keep the path as short as possible unziping the JUICE SKD near your filesystem root.***

 * Configure the local metakernel paths. This step creates a working copy of the metakernel (local) that can be used directly by the plugin and the spice toolkit. A convenience **command line tool** is provided for this purpose in the SKD.

#### 🍎 macOS / 🐧 Linux

```
$ cd <JUICE_SKD_PATH>
$ ./misc/git_hooks/skd_post_merge/update_local_mks.sh
```

####  🪟 Windows

```
> cd <JUICE_SKD_PATH>
> copy misc\git_hooks\skd_post_merge\update_local_*.bat  misc\git_hooks
> misc\git_hooks\update_local_mks.bat
```

### 3. Getting and installing Cosmographia

 The latest version ***4.2*** of SPICE-enhanced Cosmographia for the different flavour of OS are available in the https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/spice/cosmographia site.

It is also available for download from the NAIF website at http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/cosmographia_components.html.


#### 🍎 macOS

1. **Download the Mac OSX DMG**

[SPICE-enhanced Cosmographia for Mac OSX (64-bit) (528 MB)](https://spiftp.esac.esa.int/cosmographia/cosmo-installer-4.2-osx.dmg) Compatibility: OS X 10.15 or later

2. **Open the DMG**
3. **Execute the installer**

⚠️ In some systems the installer may show a warning, preventing the execution of the installer.

To workaround this issue, the installer must be extracted into a temporary folder (e.g. Downloads) and execute the following commands in a terminal:
```
$ xattr -d  com.apple.quarantine cosmo-installer.app/
$ ./cosmo-installer.app/Contents/MacOS/cosmo-installer
```
After installing, the temporary installer can be deleted.

2. **Follow the wizard instructions**

🙏  ***Please, take note of the install folder path, we will use it later.*** 



#### 🐧 Linux

1. **Download the Linux installer**

[SPICE-enhanced Cosmographia for Linux (64-bit) (636 MB)](https://spiftp.esac.esa.int/cosmographia/cosmo-installer-4.2-linux)
Compatibility: Built on a machine running Ubuntu 16, but should run under most modern versions of the Linux operating system such as CentOS, RHEL and SUSE.

2. **Follow the wizard instructions**

🙏 ***Please, take note of the install folder path, we will use it later.*** 


#### 🪟 Windows

1. **Download the Windows installer**

[SPICE-enhanced Cosmographia for Windows (64-bit) (560 MB)](https://spiftp.esac.esa.int/cosmographia/cosmo-installer-4.2-windows.exe) Compatibility: Windows 10 or later


2. **Follow the wizard instructions**

🙏 ***Please, take note of the install folder path, we will use it later.*** 



### 4. Getting and installing the ESS Cosmographia plugin

⚠️ Temporary workaround ⚠️

* Clone the plugin repository in the filesystem.

        git clone https://github.com/esaSPICEservice/ess-plugin.git



### 5. Setting up the Cosmographia plugin 

#### 🍎 macOS/ 🐧 Linux

* Open a terminal
* Navigate to the **ess-plugin** repository directory

      $ cd ess-plugin

* Execute the generic launcher script. The first time, it will ask for the full path of the Cosmographia installation. It saves that path in ~/.cosmo_path. On subsequent runs, it uses the saved path automatically. You can reset the saved path anytime, deleting the file.

       $ ./plugin_launcher.sh

After the configuration is completed, cosmographia can be closed, it will be ready for the next session. 


####  🪟 Windows (PowerShell terminal)

* Open a PowerShell terminal
* Navigate to the **ess-plugin** repository directory

      PS> cd ess-plugin
* Execute the generic launcher script. The first time, it will ask for the full path of the Cosmographia installation. It saves that path in .cosmo_path file in your user home folder. On subsequent runs, it uses the saved path automatically. You can reset the saved path anytime, deleting the file.

      PS> .\plugin_laucher.ps1

After the configuration is completed, cosmographia can be closed, it will be ready for the next session. 


## 🏃🏼‍♂️‍➡️🏃‍♀️‍➡️ Running the plugin: JUICE PTR 🎯
The plugin allows to test and design pointing requests for the JUICE spacecraft. Using OSVE in the background, it will display the attitude of the spacecraft that is defined in a PTR file. The plugin allows to display instrument sensors field of view and some science structures of the Jovian system.

#### 🍎 macOS/ 🐧 Linux

* Open a terminal and navigate to the **ess-plugin** repository directory

      $ cd ess-plugin
* Execute the launcher

      $ .\plugin_launcher.sh juice_ptr

####  🪟 Windows (PowerShell terminal)
* Open a PowerShell terminal and navigate to the **ess-plugin** repository directory

      PS> cd ess-plugin
* Execute the launcher

      PS> .\plugin_launcher.ps1 juice_ptr

## [Extra] 🏃🏼‍♂️‍➡️🏃‍♀️‍➡️ Running the plugin: Adding stars ✨

Cosmographia by default only shows named stars whose magnitude is in a limited range. This behavior can be changed to show labeled points at any J2000 referenced position using the following plugin. This could be useful for stellar occultations checking or calibration planning.

The plugin will add the stars to the cosmographia database and will be ready for the next sessions.

#### 🍎 macOS/ 🐧 Linux

* Open a terminal and navigate to the **ess-plugin** repository directory

      $ cd ess-plugin
* Execute the launcher

      $ .\plugin_launcher.sh stardb

####  🪟 Windows (PowerShell terminal)
* Open a PowerShell terminal and navigate to the **ess-plugin** repository directory

      PS> cd ess-plugin
* Execute the launcher

      PS> .\plugin_launcher.ps1 stardb



## [Extra II] 🏃🏼‍♂️‍➡️🏃‍♀️‍➡️ Running the plugin: Visualise kernel based scenes 🎇

This extra plugin allows to visualise the JUICE (and other ESA planetary missions) spacecraft context based on existing kernels.

The plugin will add the stars to the cosmographia database and will be ready for the next sessions.

#### 🍎 macOS/ 🐧 Linux

* Open a terminal and navigate to the **ess-plugin** repository directory
